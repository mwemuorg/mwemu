# pymwemu

## initialization

```python
import pymwemu
emu = pymwemu.init32()
or
emu = pymwemu.init64()

    # you can also skip loading apps and maps manually by initializing for a specific OS:
emu.init_win32()
    # For linux: dynamic bool flag determines if the environment should be set up for a dynamically linked executable.
emu.init_linux64(dynamic=True)

    # It is necessary to load the 32bits or 64bits maps folder for having a realistic memory layout.
    # The maps can be downloaded from the https://github.com/sha0coder/mwemu
emu.load_maps(folder:str)

    # Load the binary to be emulated.
emu.load_binary(filename:str)
    # Load the bytes to be emulated.
emu.load_code_bytes(bytes:bytearray)

    # load from existing serialization/dumps
emu = pymwemu.deserialize(data:list)
emu = pymwemu.load(filename:str)
emu = pymwemu.load_from_file(filename:str)
emu = pymwemu.load_from_minidump(filename:str)
```

optionally is possible to change entry point and base address

    # change the default entry point.
set_entry_point(addr:int)

    # rebase the program address.
set_base_address(addr:int)

```

### hooks 

libmwemu provide multipe hooks, but not pymwemu.
one opion is synchronous way:

```python
def GetUserNameA():
    retaddr = emu.stack_pop64()
    print('GetUserNameA')
    emu.write_string(emu.get_reg('rcx'), 'baremetal\x00')
    emu.write_qword(emu.get_reg('rdx'), 9)
    emu.set_reg('rax', emu.get_reg('rcx'))

def recv():
    retaddr = emu.stack_pop64()
    rip = emu.get_reg('rip')
    rcx = emu.get_reg('rcx')
    rdx = emu.get_reg('rdx')
    r8 = emu.get_reg('r8')
    print(f'{rip:x}: recv({rcx}, {rdx:x}, {r8})')
    emu.write_dword(rdx, 3)
    emu.set_reg('rax', 4)


emu.set_reg('rip', comm_protocol)
while True:
    addr, name = emu.run_until_apicall()
    if name == 'getusernamea':
        GetUserNameA()
    elif name =='recv':
        recv()
    else:
        emu.handle_winapi(addr)
```
